Thank you for your interest in MyoSight. First download the instruction manual, the program itself (MyoSight.ijm), and the test images. You will not be able to open these images without ImageJ or FIJI. MyoSight is specifically designed for Fiji version: 2.1.0/1.53c, so look for this particular version. The channel and color information you will need to run the program for each image is described below this paragraph. The default parameters should work well for these images, but you can adjust as you see fit. On the third image, the threshold for type IIb fiber recognition may need to be <2000, or you can enhance the contrast/brightness of the MHC IIb channel and reanalyze with a new threshold value. 

Test image 1.
Channel 1 = MHC I (Magenta),
channel 2 = Laminin (Red),
Channel 3 = MHC IIa (Green),
Channel 4 = DAPI (Blue)

Test image 2
Channel 1 = DAPI (Blue),
Channel 2 = Laminin (Red),
Channel 3 = MHC I (Magenta),
Channel 4 = MHC IIa (Green),
Channel 5 = MHC IIb (Yellow)

Test Image 3
Channel 1 = DAPI (Blue),
Channel 2 = Laminin (Red),
Channel 3 = MHC IIa (Green),
Channel 4 = MHC IIb (Yellow),
Channel 5 = MHC I(Magenta)
