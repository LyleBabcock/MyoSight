Thank for your interest in MyoSight. First download the instruction manual, the program itself (MyoSight.ijm), and the test images. You will not be able to open these images without ImageJ or FIJI, so download FIJI if you have not already done so (link and download instructions in the instruction manual). The channel and color information you will need to run the program for each image is described below this paragraph. The default parameters should work well for both images, but you can adjust as you see fit. 

Test image 1.
Channel 1 = MHC I (Magenta)
channel 2 = Laminin (Red)
Channel 3 = MHC IIa (Green)
Channel 4 = DAPI (Blue)

Test image 2
Channel 1 = DAPI (Blue)
Channel 2 = Laminin (Red)
Channel 3 = MHC I (Magenta)
Channel 4 = MHC IIa (Green)
Channel 5 = MHC IIb (Yellow)
